# Multiple Choice Exam Grader

This project aims to simplify the grading of multiple-choice exams. Using a template spreadsheet, the user inputs the correct answers and the students' answers. The system processes this information and generates a new spreadsheet with:

- **Individual Grades**: Each student's score on the exam.
- **Class Average**: The average score of the class.
- **Most Missed Questions**: A ranking of the questions that most students got wrong.
- **(Future) Graphs**: A clearer and more intuitive visualization of the results _(under development)_.

## How It Works

1. **Filling Out the Spreadsheet**: The user downloads the template spreadsheet and fills it with the exam data.
2. **Uploading the Spreadsheet**: The completed spreadsheet is uploaded to the system through the website.
3. **Processing**: The system analyzes the data and generates the spreadsheet with the results.
4. **Downloading the Spreadsheet**: The user downloads the new spreadsheet with the processed information.

## Benefits

- **Speed**: Automates the grading of exams, saving time.
- **Accuracy**: Eliminates manual errors in grading.
- **Analysis**: Allows you to identify students' difficulties and the most problematic questions.
